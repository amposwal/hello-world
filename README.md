# hello-world
setting up first repository

Hi Everyone,

My name is Andirya (Andrew) and this is my github page. I'm a Husband, son, brother and friend. I love music either listening or playing/creating. I'm currently a graduate student for Data Science with experience as a technical business analyst. I'm looking to step into the data science world and am looking forward to contributing and collaborating with those who share the same interests.

Andrew
